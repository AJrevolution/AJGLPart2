# AJGLPart2


AJGL.cpp for main

planned features:

- anti aliaising
- shadows
- ambient occlusion
- particle system
- general scene updates (improving the model loader too... need to make it more friendly to outside models, trying to use gltf for 3d models)
- different types of lights
- volumetric effects (god rays, maybe fog)
- physics
- more eventually

no particular order.
